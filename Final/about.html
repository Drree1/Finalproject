                <p>We named our website "Speedy Health" because we wanted to provide a new way of getting faster healthcare. We know how it feels to get to a medical center and have to fill out paperwork then wait for what feels like forever. With Speedy Health, the users can log on to the website, they will then be prompted to enter some personal 
                    information that will be stored and sent to the medical center of their chose ahead of time so it shortens the wait time. If they are in need of medical attention, they will 
                    be able to see what medical center is closest to their location. They would then be 
                    able to see what medical center has the shortest wait times, best reviews and 
                    see what one center does better than another.
